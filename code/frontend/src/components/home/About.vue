          Hi! Incase you were curious about how we developed Smart Shoppers we are here to 
          provide some high level information. The frontend website is built through javascript
          on the vue framework. We have integrated AWS Amplify to ensure that your account information
          is secure. Backend is developed in the go programming language.
